Write 2 programs for pricing European binary calls on a non-dividend-paying stock. 
One uses a trinomial tree, and the other the Monte Carlo method. 

Output its price, delta, and gamma from both. 

For trinomial tree, you may use the one on pp. 644-648 of the slides. 
(If so, the convergence may be slightly better by treating the strike price as the barrier in determining your l). 

For the Monte Carlo method, one time step suffices as the lecture notes show. 
If you use any nontrivial ideas in either the trinomial tree or Monte Carlo to improve convergence or accuracy, please write them down in your explaining notes. 
(Antithetic variates, e.g., will not be considered nontrivial :-) 

Inputs: 
S (stock price), 
X (strike price), 
r (annual interest rate in percentage), 
s (annual volatility in percentage), 
t (year), n (total number of periods), 
m (number of sample paths of simulation; so an antithetic method will produce twice that number of paths), 
e (see pp. 758ff). 

For example, suppose S = 100, X = 90, r = 5%, s = 40%, t = 2, n = 1000, m = 1000000, and e = 0.001. 
For the trinomial tree, the price, delta, and gamma are about 0.47805, 0.006262, and -0.00007036, respectively. 
For Monte Carlo, our price is around [0.48112, 0.48158], our delta is around [0.0039934, 0.0092489], and our gamma is around [-4.796, 5.1489].
