Write a binomial tree program to calculate the call and put prices of European and American options. 

Inputs: 
S (stock price at time = 0), 
X (strike price), 
s (annual volatility in percentage), 
t (maturity in years), 
n (the number of periods), 
r (interest rate in percentage). 

For example, suppose S = 100, X = 95, s = 25%, t = 1, n = 300, and r = 3%. 
For European options, the call price is about 13.9640 and the put price is about 6.1564. 
For American options, the call price is about 13.9640 and the put price is about 6.3440.
