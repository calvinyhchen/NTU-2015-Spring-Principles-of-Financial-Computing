Write a binomial tree program to calculate the call and put prices of Bermuda options when there are (trading) holidays. 

For Bermuda options, exercise is possible only for a specific time interval and then only at the close of each trading day during that interval. 
Assume only Saturdays and Sundays are holidays for simplicity. 
All dates are in the yyyy-mm-dd format. 

Inputs: 
S (stock price at the starting date), 
X (strike price), 
s (annual volatility in percentage), 
T0 (starting date), 
T1 (maturity date of option), 
m (the number of periods per day for the tree), 
r (annual interest rate in percentage), 
T2 (starting date when option can be exercised). 
T3 (final date when option can be exercised). 

For example, suppose S = 100, X = 95, s = 35%, T0 = 2015-04-21, T1 = 2015-06-19, m = 2, r = 0%, T2 = 2015-05-21, and T3 = 2015-06-19. 
The call price is about 8.4471, and the put price is about 3.4471. 

Suppose we have the same parameters as above except that r = 10%. Then the call price is about 9.4205, and the put price is about 2.9370.
