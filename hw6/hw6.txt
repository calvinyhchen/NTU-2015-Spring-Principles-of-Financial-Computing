Write a program to price an x-year European call option on a zero-coupon bond that matures at year y with a par value of 1 dollar. 

Use a binomial tree for the Ho-Lee model. 

Assume the market spot rate curve is r(t) = E - Fe-Gt (annualized and continuously compounded). 

Inputs: 
x (year), 
y (year), 
s (%) (constant annualized volatility of short rate), 
E, 
F, 
G, 
n (the number of time periods of the tree), 
X (strike price in % of par). 

For example, the option price is about XXX (% of par) when x = 1, y = 2, E = 0.08, F = 0.05, G = 0.18, s = 10 (%), n = 30, and X = 90 (%).
